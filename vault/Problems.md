Collection of Data Structure and Algorithm Problems, with explanation and solution in both java and javascript with links to concepts that pertain to the problem.

## Strategies

Array and Strings

We can use two pointers, HashMap and HashSet

If problem involves something where an array is sorted, we can use either a binary search or two pointer method.

If it inolves a linked list we can use a two pointer approach

If it involves a Tree or a Graph we can use DFS, and BFS

---

if problem asks for (Frequency/counter/duplicates/commmon string) think about using maps

if problem asks for (Top/ Least K Items) think about using Heap

if problem asks for (Maximum/minimum/subarray/subs etc..) think about using Dynamic Programming

if problem asks for (Permutation/Subsets) think about using Back Tracking

if problem asks for (Recursion is prohibited) think about using Stack

if problem asks for (common String) think about using Map or Trie
