Collection of Data Structure and Algorithm Problems, with explanation and solution in both java and javascript with links to concepts that pertain to the problem.

Most questions present have an obvious pattern, can be broken down to it's basic pattern. The first step is always brute force but we can follow these patterns into optimizing our solutions. These patterns usually lead you to the most optimal solution time complexity wise.

## Patterns

1. Sliding Window
2. Two Pointers / Iterators
3. Fast and Slow Pointers
4. Merge Intervals
5. Cyclic Sort
6. In-Place Reversal of Linked Lists
7. Tree BFS/DFS
8. Two Heaps
9. Subsets
10. Modified Binary Search
11. Top K Elements
12. K-Way Merge
13. Topological Sort

## Other Strategies

Array and String We can use two pointers, HashMap and HashSet.

If problem involves something where an array is sorted, we can use either a binary search or two pointer method.

If it involves a linked list we can use a two pointer approach

If it involves a Tree or a Graph we can use DFS, and BFS

if problem asks for (Frequency/counter/duplicates/common string) think about using maps

if problem asks for (Top/ Least K Items) think about using Heap

if problem asks for (Maximum/minimum/subarray/subs etc..) think about using Dynamic Programming

if problem asks for (Permutation/Subsets) think about using Back Tracking

if problem asks for (Recursion is prohibited) think about using Stack

if problem asks for (common String) think about using Map or Trie
