<p>Binary Tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children,left child and right child. Usually nodes in a tree can have multiple children but binary trees can have only two max. They are a useful data structure for storing data such as numbers and allow for fast lookup using binary search functionality.</p>
<p>the number of children each node has in a tree is called branching factor, and as such a binary tree has a branching factor of 2.</p>
<p>Similar to linked list a binary tree has a node which contains a value and a pointer to another node. But in a binary tree it has two pointers one for the left child and one for the right child.</p>

<p>A binary tree uis made up of nodes and links/edges, The nodes represent the data stored in the tree, and the node at the top is called the root while every other node is a child node or a parent node. The nodes which point to no other node are called Leaf nodes. Nodes which have the same parent are called sibling nodes.</p>
<p>In general the number of nodes present in a tree will be one more than the number of edges/links present. Thus you can find the number of nodes present by counting the number of edges and adding one.</p>
<p>Below you can find how simple it is to search though a binary tree.

<p>Another thing to pay attention for binary trees is the depth, node height, and tree height. To maximize efficiency of searching for an element in the tree.</p>
<p>We say that the <strong>depth</strong> of a node is the number of links from the root to the node. Thus the root node has a depth of zero and its direct children have a depth of 1.</p>
<p>We say that the <strong>height</strong> of a tree is the depth of the deepest node present in the tree from the root node. When we want to find a specific <strong>node height</strong> we look at the number of edges present from that node to a leaf node.</p>
<p>To find the maximum/larges number of nodes a binary tree can have we use this formula: 2^(height or n) - 1 max nodes possible at each tree height.</p>

<p>A given binary tree can be a full or complete binary tree. When we say a full binary tree we mean that each node has either exactly zero or two children. Since every node has to point to at least two nodes after the root node, a full binary tree cannot have an even number of nodes.</p>
<p>Whereas a complete binary tree is completely filled(except the last level sometimes) and is made so that all given sub nodes are as far left as possible.</p>
